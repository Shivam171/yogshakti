# YogShakti - A Yoga Studio Website 🧘‍♂️

## Introduction 🌟

YogShakti is a responsive yoga studio website built upon the foundation of "Yogmetic," originally created by [hodanmohamed](https://github.com/hodanmohamed). I am deeply grateful for their inspiring work in developing a beautiful website for Yogmetic.

## Original Project 🏆

[hodanmohamed's Yogmetic Repository](https://github.com/hodanmohamed/yogmetic)

"Hodanmohamed's Yogmetic is a responsive website designed for Yogmetic, a yoga studio. It utilizes HTML, Sass, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and visually appealing website, catering to yoga enthusiasts, practitioners, and potential clients. The website offers information about Yogmetic's services, instructors, class schedules, and a seamless user experience for both beginners and experienced yogis."

## Changes and Enhancements ✨

In the process of recreating "YogShakti" from "Yogmetic," I made several modifications and added new features:

- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented JavaScript to perform client-side validation on the booking form to enhance user experience.

- **Server-Side Validation**: Integrated server-side validation using PHP to ensure data integrity and security.

- **Database Integration**: Connected the website to a MySQL database using PHP for dynamic content management, such as class schedules and instructor information.

- **Additional Features**: Introduced new features and content to tailor the website to YogShakti's unique identity.
